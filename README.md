# FastMud

**Maybe you've already thought the following:**

> "If glass bottles can turn dirt into mud, then why doesn't a bucket of water work? Wouldn't it make more sense if running water could make mud? 🤔"

It was after thinking a lot about this logical inconsistency, as well as spending a lot of time with glass bottles, that I decided to create this plugin and share it with you! 😁

However, lakes generated around the world WILL NOT AFFECT underwater dirts! The reason is the overwhelming loss of performance, although it is a cool idea it does not seem feasible. [See more details here](https://github.com/d3cryptofc/FastMud/issues/1).

## ⚡️ Compatibility

Mud was officially introduced in Minecraft version 1.19, and it is my hope that this plugin will be compatible with 1.19+. Testing has only been done with 1.21.4, so please create an issue on github if it breaks in lower versions. Thank you!
