# FastMud

**Maybe you've already thought the following:**

_"If glass bottles can turn dirt into mud, then why doesn't a bucket of water work? Wouldn't it make more sense if running water could make mud? 🤔"_

And it was thinking a lot about this, spending a lot of time, that I decided to create this plugin for a personal logic correction, and I decided to share it with you 😁

## 🎉 Features

- When player uses water bucket.
- When water flows.

## ⚡️ Compatibility

Mud was officially introduced in Minecraft version 1.19, and it is my hope that this plugin will be compatible with 1.19+. Testing has only been done with 1.21.4, so please create an issue on github if it breaks in lower versions. Thank you!
